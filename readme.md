Problem Description: 13.7
(The Colorable interface) 
* Design an interface named Colorable with a void

the Colorable interface. 
* Design a class named Square that extends
GeometricObject and implements Colorable. 
* Implement howToColor to
display the message "Color all four sides".
* Draw a UML diagram that involves Colorable, Square, and GeometricObject.
* Write a test program that creates an array of five GeometricObjects. For each
object in the array, display its area and invoke its howToColor method if it is
colorable.

Submit the files including the UML diagram using GitHub.
